# Break Azure VMs
## Purpose
Inject custom scripts into Azure VMs to reproduce certain issues.

## Setup
1. Install VSCode: https://aka.ms/vscode
2. Install Azure Resource Manager (ARM) Tools: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=msazurermtools.azurerm-vscode-tools
3. Don't have a GitHub account? Create one: https://github.com/join
4. Install GitHub Desktop and sign into it: https://desktop.github.com/
5. Install Git for Windows: https://gitforwindows.org/
6. Fork my repo: https://github.com/rjmccallumbigl/Azure-ARM-Templates/fork
7. On the GitHub page for your fork, click the green Code button and click "Open with GitHub Desktop".
   	* If GitHub Desktop asks where you'd like to save your repo, I save it in my user profile folder `%userprofile%\GitHub` outside of OneDrive or other cloud storage.
8. In GitHub Desktop click "Open in Visual Studio Code".
9. You can now update or create new templates for the repo.

## Additional Extensions
There should be an `extensions.json` file with additional extensions. These should help in the development of the PowerShell/BAT/Bash/Shell.
